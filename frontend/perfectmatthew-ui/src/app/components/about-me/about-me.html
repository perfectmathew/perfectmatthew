        I come from a charming town <span class="text-blue-200 font-semibold">Głuchołazy in Poland</span>.
        My adventure with programming began in my youth, driven by curiosity and a desire to create. 
        From my fascination with writing my own plugins for the <span class="text-blue-200 font-semibold">Minecraft</span> server to configuring and developing the <span class="text-blue-200 font-semibold">Metin2</span> server, this early stage shaped my passion for code.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-blue-100 mb-0 leading-relaxed">
        I've always had a head full of ideas, and now, thanks to creating this space,
        I share them and my work with the world. 
        Besides programming, my favorite form of relaxation is a good read, both in traditional form and as an <span class="text-blue-200 font-semibold">audiobook</span>.
